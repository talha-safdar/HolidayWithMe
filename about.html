                                                I am Tellha Safdar and I am a student at University of Salford, currently studying Computer Science with Cyber Security. This interests me because I wanted to develop a new innovative security layer system online, which would ensure the safety against cyber-attacks. In my spare time I like to read books and staying up to date with the latest technology. Moreover, I also like to travel, in fact last year in summer I had travelled to Rome and London, two of the most densely populated cities.

                                                During my time in London, I found out many things about the lifestyle in London and the monuments that surround this huge city. First of all, it was a very busy city, I had seen many people walking around in a hurry with uniforms and briefcases. Secondly, London eye, which is an observation wheel, could go so high, from where you could have a wide view of panorama, the most exciting thing was to be able to see the big ben from the top. Lastly, the thing that impressed me the most was how the city is a mixture of different ethnicities, which was very cool.

                                                Going to Rome, was one of my best experience as I love visiting antique monuments that regard the Roman empire. When I firstly have been in Rome I rushed to go to visit the Colosseum, which is the main symbol of the Roman empire, I was surprised how a monument built so many years ago is still standing. Another thing that I liked about Rome is that you feel like you are in two different eras at the same time as wherever you go around the city you can easily find ancient architectures. Regarding the weather, is beautiful as most of the times is sunny and the sea is not even far away.
